 Employee Data Analysis Project  This project analyzes employee data from ABC company, providing insights into team distribution, position segregation, age groups, salary expenditure, and the correlation between age and salary.
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Corrects the 'height' column by replacing existing values with random numbers within a specified range.  Handles missing (null) values in the dataset using imputation (filling with appropriate values like median or mode) to ensure data integrity for analysis.

2. **Employee Distribution Across Teams:** Calculates and visualizes the distribution of employees across different teams, including percentage splits.

3. **Employee Segregation by Position:**  Determines and displays the distribution of employees based on their positions within the company.

4. **Predominant Age Group:** Identifies and analyzes the age distribution of employees, including calculating and displaying descriptive statistics and the median age.

5. **Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure:**  Calculates and identifies the team and position combination with the highest total salary expenditure.
